# About Me
I am an undergraduate at Caltech studying electrical and computer engineering. My coursework relevant to my interests include advanced embedded and digital systems design, computing systems, signal processing, PCB design, and feedback and control circuits. 

I am fascinated by the way hardware and software can be integrated together, and I have published a variety of projects on my website (see Portfolio tab) that capture my interests. I hope you enjoy reading about my projects, and please feel free to reach out if you would like to connect!
